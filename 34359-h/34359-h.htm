<p class="normal"><i>The scene represents the King's tent. The curtains are open
in the background and permit a view through the camp of the Gothic warriors,
over toward Vesuvius, and the distant sea, which shine in the splendour of the
setting sun. On the left stands the rudely constructed throne of the King. In
the centre, a table with seats around it. On the right, the King's couch,
consisting of skins pieced together; above, a rack holding many kinds of
weapons. Link torches on the right and left.</i></p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><i>FIRST SCENE</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc2">TWO CAMP WATCHERS</span>.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ho thou! Art thou fallen asleep?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why should I be fallen asleep?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Because thou leanest so limber upon thy spear, bent like the
bow of a Hun.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I stand so bent, because thus hunger gripes me less.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">'Tis of no avail. It availeth as little as thy belt.
Afterward, in standing upright, it is the more severe.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How long is this to last?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Until the ships come--that is simple indeed.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yea, but when are the ships coming?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How can I know that? Look toward the heights. There, high upon
the Milchberg, there standeth the watch, and overlooketh the sea for twenty
miles. If he knoweth not! There, behind the Misenian hills, there they must be
coming.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Verily, if the Byzantian let them pass.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The Byzantian hath no ships.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The Byzantian hath so many ships that he can surround the
whole Italian world with them as with a hedge; as close as the Byzantian Eunuch
hath surrounded us, these seven weeks.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">These seven weeks!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Knowest thou what I got for nourishment, at noon this day? The
same rind of bacon on which I brake my teeth eight days ago. Forsooth, I had cut
my three crosses, with my knife. That was a meeting again! But to-day, I
devoured it ... a noble feast for a king's marriage day!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Think'st thou the King had more?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And think'st thou we would suffer ourselves to be beaten to
death, suffer ourselves to be broken on the wheel, to be thrust through and put
to shame, if he had more than we? Think'st thou we would lie here like chained
dogs, and watch, did we not know that there is nothing to watch?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There is gold enough.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Gold! Pah, gold! Of gold I have enough myself. In my cellar at
Canusium, I have buried a treasure--eh! ... thou! The wives behind there in the
Wagenburg must have meat left ... wine too, they must still have.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yea, the wives are there well enough--thou hast none, I
suppose.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A Greek dishonoured mine, and I stabbed him to death! (<i>Pauses</i>.)
Good! The wives must have meat; they must have wine too. But how long that-- (<i>Noise
and clash of weapons, slowly approaching</i>.) There, the marriage is surely
ended.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Silence! There cometh the aged Ildibad--with the King's
shield. (<i>Both put themselves on guard</i>.)</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><i>SECOND SCENE</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc2">THE SAME</span>. <span class="sc2">ILDIBAD</span>.</p>


<p class="normal">(<i>Hangs the shield in its place, and puts away the weapons
lying about</i>.) Hath any news been sent down?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">First Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nay!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are ye hungry?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Second Camp Watcher</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yea.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hunger is for women--mark ye that! And show not such dark
faces to our young Queen. That becometh not a marriage day.</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><i>THIRD SCENE</i>.</h2>

<p class="normal"><i>Surrounded by noisy people</i>, <span class="sc2">Teja </span><i>
and </i><span class="sc2">Balthilda </span><i>have appeared in front of the
tent. They enter led by </i><span class="sc2">Bishop Agila</span>. <i>Before
them, two choir-boys swinging censers. Behind them</i>, <span class="sc2">
Amalaberga</span>, <span class="sc2">Euric</span>,
<span class="sc2">Athanaric</span>, <span class="sc2">Theodemir</span>, <i>and
other lords and military leaders. The tent covers are let down. Exeunt the
watchers</i>.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">(<span class="sc2">Bishop </span><i>lets go the hands of the
bridal pair, and turns back to </i>
<span class="sc2">Amalaberga</span>.)

<p class="normal">(<span class="sc2">Teja </span><i>stands gloomy and brooding</i>. <span class="sc2">
Balthilda </span><i>casts a shy imploring look around her. Painful silence</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span> (<i>softly</i>).</p>
<br>
<p class="normal">Now must thou say something, King, to welcome thy young wife.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span> (<i>softly</i>).</p>
<br>
<p class="normal">Must I? (<i>Taking
one of the choir-boys by the nape of the neck</i>.) Not so vehemently, boy; the
smoke cometh up into our nostrils. What dost thou when thou wieldest not thy
censer?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Boy</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I wield my sword, King.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That is right. But make ye haste with wielding the sword, or
ye may easily be too late. (<i>Softly</i>.) Nothing to be seen of the ships,
Ildibad?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing, my King. But thou must speak to thy young wife.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yea ... so now I have a wife, Bishop?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bishop</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Here standeth thy wife. King, and waiteth on thy word.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Forgive me, Queen, if I find not this word. I have been
brought up in the midst of battles, and other dwelling-place have I not known.
It will be hard for thee to share this with me.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">King ... my mother ... taught me ... (<i>She stops</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span> (<i>with assumed kindness</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">And what taught thee thy mother?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Amalaberga</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That a wife belongeth to her husband--above all, in the hour
of distress; she taught her that, King.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That may indeed be true and holy to ye wives.... If only the
husband also belonged to his wife in the hour of distress. And yet one thing,</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Amalaberga</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It hath been told me that in the morning, cocks crow near ye
wives yonder in the Wagenburg. For weeks, the warriors have eaten no meat. I
counsel ye, give them the cocks. (<span class="sc2">Amalaberga </span><i>bows</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bishop</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My King!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Heh! Thou hast but now spoken so beautifully at the
field-altar,</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bishop</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Dost thou desire to preach so soon again?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bishop</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I will speak to thee, because bitterness devoureth thy soul.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Verily? Thou thinkest it? Then I give ear.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bishop</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Behold, like the spirit of divine wrath, so hast thou risen up
among us, young man.... Not thy years did the nation count, only thy deeds....
Old men bowed willingly to thy youth, and since thou hadst yet a long time to
serve, as one of the humblest, wert thou already our ruler. From the golden
throne of Theoderic, where mercy had sat in judgment, where Totilas bestowed
pardon with a smile, rang out sternly thy bloody word ... And woe clave to us as
a poisoned wound.... Pursued hither and thither beneath the hot outpourings of
Vesuvius, we are now encamped with women and children; while Byzantium, with its
hireling soldiers, holdeth us surrounded.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That it surely doth, ha, ha! Not a mouse can come through.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bishop</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Our gaze wandereth wistfully seaward: for thence hath God
promised us bread.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No tidings of the ships?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span> (softly). Nothing.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bishop</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Before we armed ourselves for a new war with misery, as free
men, true to the ancient law, we determined to choose thee a wife, for in his
own body should the King taste why the Goth loveth death.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Found ye that your King loved life overmuch?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bishop</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My King!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nay, that dared ye not, for every hour of this life would hold
ye up to mockery.... And even if the ancient law required it, why must ye weld
me with this young thing which, trembling for fear before me and ye, hideth in
her mother's skirts? And especially on so fitting a day, when hunger doth
furnish the marriage music.... Look upon me, Queen--I must call thee by thy
title of a half-hour, for, by God! I hardly yet know thy name. I pray thee, look
upon me! Dost thou know me?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thou art the King, Sire.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yea. But for thee I should be man, not King.... And knowest
thou what manner of man standeth here before thee?... Behold! These arms have
been hitherto plunged in reeking blood, not the blood of men shed in manly
strife, I speak not of that, that honoureth the man--blood of unarmed pale
children, of--(<i>shudders</i>)--Thou shalt have great joy, if I come with these
arms to wind them about thy neck.... Dost thou indeed hear me? Have I not a
beautiful voice, a sweet voice? Only it is a little hoarse. It is weary with
screaming loud commands to murder.... Peculiar pleasure shall be thine when thou
hearest tender words with this bewitching hoarseness. Am I not truly a born
lover? These wise men knew that; therefore they taught me my calling.... Or
believe ye, it was your duty to beguile your King in the weariness of camp life;
as the great Justinian dallied in golden Byzantium, and sent forth his eunuchs
to slay Gothic men? Ha, ha, ha!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Bishop</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My King, take heed lest thou be angry.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I thank thee, friend. Yet that signifieth nothing. It is but
my marriage humour.... But now I will speak to ye in earnest--(<i>Ascends to the
high seat of the throne</i>.) On the golden throne of Theoderic, where mercy sat
in judgment, can I, alas! not take my place; for that is being chopped into
firewood at Byzantium.... Neither smiling like Totilas can I pardon, for no one
longer desireth our pardon.... From the glorious nation of the Goths, there hath
sprung a horde of hungry wolves therefore it needeth a wolf as master. Thou,
Bishop, didst call me the spirit of divine wrath, which I am not.... I am but
the spirit of your despair. As one who all his life hath hoped for nothing, hath
wished for nothing, I stand before you, and so I shall fall before you. That ye
knew, and therefore ye are wrong, ye men, to reproach me secretly. Contradict me
not!... I read it clearly enough between your lowering brows.... Because it
goeth ill with us, make not a scapegoat of me--that I counsel ye.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Theodemir</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">King, wound us not.... The last drop of our blood belongeth to
thee. Cast us not into the pot with these old men. Euric. We old men fight as
well as they; and love, young man, as well as they.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then let that suffice. Your Queen shall soon enough learn how,
in misfortune, friends quarrel among themselves. And as ye pass through the
camp, tell the warriors, the only thing that frets the King this day this day of
joy, is it not?--is that he hath not the power to offer them a worthy marriage
feast ... or yet perchance-- Ildibad.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Who on the right has secretly spoken in bewilderment to a watcher who has
just entered</i>.) Yea, Sire.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What have we still in our stores, old man?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span> (<i>controlling his emotion</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Truly, thou hast given away almost all thy provisions.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I ask thee, what remaineth?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A jar of fermented milk, and two stale crusts of bread.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ha, ha, ha! Now thou seest, Queen, what a poor husband thou
hast got. Yet if the ships be there, as the people say, then will I do royal
honours to every one, even as is his due. Yet tell it not, that would mar their
joy. But if they hear the trumpets sound, then tell them there will be meat and
wine on the long tables, so much as--</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">(<i>To </i><span class="sc2">Ildibad</span>,
<i>who glides across the stage to his side</i>) What is it?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span> (<i>softly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">The watch departeth. The ships are lost.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Without the least change of countenance</i>.)
Lost--how--in what way?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Treason.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yea, verily! Yea--meat and wine so much as each one will, at
long white tables--I shall have it divided--and Sicilian fruits for the women,
and sweetmeats from Massilia. (<i>Sinks reeling upon the seat of the throne, and
gazes absently into the distance</i>.) The Men. What aileth the King? Look to
the King!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Theodemir. Euric.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The Watcher. The Lords.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I have sent away the women and the priest; for what comes now
concerneth us warriors alone. Where is the watcher? Come forth, man. The Men
(muttering). The watcher from the hill! The watcher!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hereby ye know, men: the ships are lost. (<i>Tumult. Cries of
horror</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Quiet, friends, quiet! Thy name is Haribalt. Watcher. Yea,
Sire!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How long hast thou stood at thy post? Watcher. Since early
yesterday, Sire.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Where are thy two companions? Watcher. They remain above, as
thou hast commanded, Sire.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good, then what saw ye? Watcher. The smoke of Vesuvius, Sire,
descended upon the sea, beyond the promontory of Misenum. Thus we saw nothing
until to-day about the sixth hour of the evening. Then suddenly the ships
appeared five in number quite near the shore, there where it is said a city of
the Romans lies buried in ruins.... One of us determined to hasten away,
since----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Stay! What signal bare the ships? Watcher. The foresail bound
crosswise and----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And? Watcher. A palm branch at the stern.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ye saw the palm branch? Watcher. As I see thee, Sire.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Good, go on. Watcher. Then we perceived that the fishing-boats
with which the Byzantians take their food, closely surrounded the ships, and
then----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What then? Watcher. Verily, Sire, they steered quite peaceably
toward the camp of the enemy. There they unloaded. (<i>The men cover their
heads. Silence</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Who looks, smiling, from one to the other</i>.) It is
good.... That is: thou shalt say nothing there without.... From me they should
learn it. (<i>Exit Watcher</i>.)</p>
<br>
<br>
<h2><i>FIFTH SCENE</i>.</h2>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>. <span class="sc2">TEJA</span>. <span class="sc2">THEODEMIR</span>. <span class="sc2">EURIC</span>. <span class="sc2">ATHANARIC </span><i>and the </i>
<span class="sc2">OTHERS</span>. <span class="sc2">LORDS</span>.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Your counsel, ye men!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Theodemir</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, we have none to give.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And thou, Euric, with all thy wisdom? Euric. Sire, I have
served the great Theoderic. And yet he would have had none to give.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Come then, I know.... It is easy and quick to be understood:
Die!... Why look ye at me with such mistrust?... Do ye not yet understand me?
Think ye I require ye to wrap yourselves in your mantles, like cowardly Greeks,
and beg your neighbours for a thrust in the back? Be calm: I will protect you
against shame, since I can no more lead you to honour.--Our place here cannot be
taken, so long as thirty of us have power to wield our spears. But the hour
shall come--and at no distant time--when the last arm, crippled by hunger, can
no more be outstretched to beg quarter of the invading murderers.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Theodemir</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No Gothic man doeth that, King!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For what thou art, thou canst give surety; for what thou shalt
become, thou givest no surety to me. So I counsel and command ye to prepare
yourselves for the last conflict. In the first gray of the morning, we shall
burst forth from the clefts, and array ourselves against the Byzantian in open
field.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">All</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, that is impossible.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Theodemir</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">King, consider, we are one against a hundred.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And thou, Euric? Euric. Sire, thou leadest us to destruction.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yea, verily. Said I anything else? Do ye believe me to be so
untried in things of war that I know not that? Why then halt ye? When Totilas
led us, we were more than a hundred thousand. Now we are but five. They all knew
how to die, and can we, a miserable remnant, have forgotten it?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">All</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nay, King,
nay! Euric. Sire, grant us time to accustom ourselves to that horrible thing.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Horrible? What seemeth horrible to ye? I speak not indeed to
Romans who reel from the mass to the lupanar, and from the lupanar to the mass.
Yet there is not one among ye whose breast is not covered with scars like an old
stone with moss. These twenty years ye have made sport of death, and now it
cometh in earnest, doth a Gothic man speak of &quot;horrible&quot;? What will ye? Will ye
lie and hunger? Will ye devour one the other, like rats? Good. But I shall not
do it with ye! Not I! To-morrow, I take spear and shield, and go to gain on my
own account the bit of death for which I long and languish like a thief since ye
made me leader of your lost cause.--And thou at least, my old companion, thou
comest with me--eh?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Ildibad</span> (<i>falling down before him</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I thank thee, Sire! Why ask whether I come!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">All</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">We too, King. We all, we all!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Theodemir</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thou shouldst be praised, King, that thou hast pointed to us
the way of happiness. And be not angry with us, if we were not able straightway
to follow thee. Now I perceive clearly thy great thought. From grief and discord
and despair, we rise, we do not go down to death.... Laughing, treadeth each on
the other's corpse, in order laughing to sink down like him.... A light will go
forth from us over the wide world.... Ah, that will be a draught from golden
goblets--that will be a riot of exultant joy. Thank thee, my King. Often have I
envied thee thy crown, now I venture to envy it no more.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">The thing will come to pass for the most part otherwise than
thou dost imagine it, Theodemir. Yet I am glad that among the Goths, such
inspiration still abideth. Euric. Also to me, King, grudge not a word; for I
have indeed seen golden days.... Thou art not only the boldest, thou art also
the wisest of all.... Had we now faltered, so should we all have fallen without
defence, by the murderer's sword ... And not only we, but the sick--and the
children--and the wives.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ay, indeed, the wives! Of them I had not thought at all.
Euric. But now to-morrow, we shall stand in battle, and on the second and third
day, if we hold out so long, so that astonishment and fear at the miracle will
lay hold on the Byzantian and all the rabble of Huns and Suevians which he
draggeth after him.... We cannot utterly destroy them, but we can bait them with
our blood till they be weary.... And when no one on that side is able to hold
spear and bow, then shall the hour come when the Eunuch will have it said:
&quot;Depart in peace.&quot; How many of ye are then still left? I fear not many----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">We, surely not!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">All</span> (<i>with cruel laughter</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Nay, we
surely not! Euric. Then shall they take wives and children into the midst of
them, and, head high, with naked swords, descend straight through the Byzantian
camp toward Naples, to buy a piece of bread. And I tell ye, with such fear shall
they be gazed at, that not even once shall a dog of the Huns dare to bark at
them.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Wife and child! Wife and child! What have we to do with them?
Athanaric. King, thou revilest the dearest of our possessions.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Maybe!--I know only that there were too many mouths in the
morning when the rations were divided. Otherwise we might have been able to
support ourselves. And yet, this one thing I say to ye--and I shall enjoin it on
the men without, upon their word as warriors--that none of the women know aught
of our purpose. I will not that even one man be softened by the tears and cries
of women. Athanaric. Sire, that is inhuman which thou requirest, to take no
leave of our wives.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Take leave of them, me notwithstanding, but remain dumb as ye
do it. He that hath wife and child here, let him go to the Wagenburg, and
provide himself food and drink, for the women delight to keep a remnant between
their fingers. This let him share with the unmarried, and be joyful when he can.
Euric. And what should they say to their wives, Sire, since already thou hast
strictly forbidden communication?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Say ye, it happens because of my marriage! Or the ships are
there, if that sounds more worthy of belief. Say what ye will. Only that one
thing, keep for yourselves.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Theodemir</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And wilt thou thyself nevermore see thy young wife?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Eh? Nay.... I mark not the least desire to. Surely now I shall
speak to the people. I would that I had thy tongue, Theodemir.--The errand is
troublesome to me, for I should speak great words, and I feel them not. Come! (<i>Exeunt

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Bishop, I have been a good servant of thy church. To dedicate
her temples, as once Totilas did, have I not been able; but what there was to

through me. Set thy basket there.... Have ye still much of such things?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, these two weeks have my mother and I and the women about
us put aside the best of our share--flour and fruits--and the fowls have we not
killed till this very day.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then indeed must ye have been mightily hungry, ye women?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, it hath done us no hurt, Sire.... It was for a feast.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In truth? Ye believed we should celebrate a feast to-day?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well ... is it then not a feast, Sire?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Is silent and bites his nether lip, examining her

go home! That too would be a reproach, would it not?</p>
<br>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Balthilda </span><i>is silent and

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And if I bade thee, wouldst thou wish to stay?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, how should a wife not wish to stay beside her husband?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hast thou then the feeling in thy heart, that
I--am--thy--husband?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed, how could it be otherwise? The Bishop hath joined us
together.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And wert thou glad when he did it?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yea.... Nay, I was not glad then.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why not?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span> (<i>with a bright glance</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps because, because ... I was afraid, Sire, and I was praying.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What didst thou pray?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That God would grant to me, his humble handmaid, the power to
bring thee the happiness which thou needest, and which thou awaitest from me.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Which I from thee--that didst thou pray?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, may I not offer thee the food, and the wine?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nay, nay!... Hearken, Balthilda: without, by our fires, are
warriors--they are hungry--I am not hungry.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, give them what thou pleasest ... give them everything!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I thank thee, Balthilda. (<i>Raising the curtain</i>.) Ho
there, watch! Come in, but
prudently so as not to wake the old man.... (<i>Watcher enters</i>.) Here, take
this basket with food and wine, and divide it honestly.... Say your Queen sends
it.</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Go--and bring me to eat!</p>
<br>

<p class="center">Balthilda (<i>perplexed</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Sire--why--mockest thou--me?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Dost thou then not understand me? If thou wilt be my wife,
thou must offer me my property, not thine!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is not all of mine thy property, Sire?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hm! (<i>Silence. He takes her hands.</i>) Call me not Sire and
call me not King.... Knowest thou not my name?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thy name is Teja!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Say it yet once again! Balthilda (<i>softly, turning away</i>).
Teja!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is the name so strange to thee? (<span class="sc2">Balthilda </span><i>shakes her head</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then why hesitate?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not for that, Sire! Since I knew that I was to serve thee as
thy wife, I have often named thee by day and in the night. Only I never said it
aloud....</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And before thou knewest it, what was then thy thought?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, why dost thou ask?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And why dost thou not answer?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, when I heard of thy bloody commands, and the others
feared thee--then I often thought: How unhappy must he be that the destiny of
the Goths compelleth him to such deeds!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That hast thou thought?--That hast thou----?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire, was it wrong that I should think it?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thou hadst never seen my face, and thou didst understand me?
And they who were around me, the wise men and tried soldiers, they understood me
not!... Who art thou, woman? Who hath taught thee to read my heart? Thee, thee
alone of all?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sire--I----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">All shuddered and muttering hid themselves from me in
corners--and saw not the way, the only way which haply might still have saved
them. When the butcher's knife was already at their throat, they still told
themselves some tale of compromise. And then came the crafty Greeks, measured
themselves with them, and killed them one by one. Thus perished the hundred
thousand. And I wrapped myself in grief and anger--I cast hope away from me like
a bloody rag, I sprang into the breach with scornful laughter. I sowed horrors
about me, when my own heart was convulsed with horror of myself. I have not once
been drunk with all the blood. I have killed, killed, and still knew all the
while: it is in vain! (<i>He sinks to his seat overcome with anguish, and stares
straight before him</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span> (<i>with a shy attempt at a caress</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">My poor dear King! Dear Teja!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Raises his head and looks confusedly around him</i>.) My
God, what do I here?... Why do I tell all this to thee? Thou must not despise me
because I am such a babbler.... Nor must thou believe that it is aught of
remorse that compels me to this confession.... Perhaps I feel pity for the
victims, but my conscience stands high above all that!... Far higher than my
poor Gothic throne.... Look not upon me so.... There is in thy eye something
that compels me to reveal my inmost thought to thee.... Who hath endued thee
with this power over me?... Begone!... Nay, stay ... Stay! I wish to tell thee
yet something, quite in secret, before thou goest.... Besides, I should not cry
out so, otherwise the watch may hear.... Incline thine ear to me. Never yet have
I confessed it to any man, nor have I held it possible that I should ever
confess it.... I bear an envy within me which devoureth my heart, whenever I
think--knowest thou toward whom?... Toward Totilas.... Yea, toward Totilas in
his grave.... They called him the &quot;shining&quot; Totilas and their affection still
cleaveth to him to-day.... Their eyes still flash when they even think of him.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, Sire, how thou dost fret thyself!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span> (<i>anxiously</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Didst thou ever see him?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Never.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">God be thanked! For hadst thou ever seen him as I saw him on
the morning of the battle in which he fell ... arrayed in golden armour ... and
the white steed pranced beneath him, and his yellow locks streamed like sunlight
about him. And he laughed the foe in the face.... Laughed like a child!... Ah,
laughing to die like him!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">His lot was easy, Sire! He went from hence, but left to thee
as an inheritance the half-destroyed kingdom.... How shouldst thou then have
laughed?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Is it not so?--Is it not so?--How ... Ah, that
doeth good! (<i>Stretching himself</i>.) Ah, thou doest me good!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How proud thou makest me, Sire!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But hadst thou seen him and compared him to me, thou wouldst
spit upon me! Balthilda (<i>fervently</i>). I should have seen only thee, Sire
dear, dear Sire!</p>

<p class="normal">(<span class="sc2">Teja </span><i>looks askance at her, shyly and distrustfully, then

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Follows him shyly and kneels down beside him</i>.) Teja,

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span> (<i>rises and grasps her arm</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Tell it to no one!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What, Sire?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That thou hast seen me weep! Swear it to me!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It hath been told me that I am now even as a piece of thy
body--and of thy soul also!... Wherefore should I swear?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If thou art a piece of my body, then come nearer to me, that
thou mayst not see my tears.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Let me dry them for thee! See, for this cause am I here.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, 'tis well with me.... I must indeed have died of shame,
for never yet hath a Gothic man been seen to weep. Even when we buried Totilas,
we wept not.... Yet I am not ashamed.... If I but knew why suddenly it is so
well with me!... Balthilda, I will tell thee something. But thou must not laugh
me to scorn.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How should I laugh at thee, beloved?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span> (<i>springing up in surprise</i>).</p>

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, it is heavy!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Now feel within! Deep, deep!... There Ildibad the old
miser--well?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span> (<i>disappointedly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">A couple of bread crusts; is that all, Sire?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There is indeed nothing more.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">May I not then go quickly over to the Wagenburg?... Perhaps

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh nay.... They themselves need the fragments.... Bring that
hither! As brothers we shall share it--eh? And then there is sufficient for
both. Wilt thou?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Balthilda</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yea. (<i>She sits beside him</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So, now give to me! Ah, that is good to the taste! Is it not

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Teja</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pray come nearer to me ... I will take the crumbs from thy lap

<p class="normal">Nay! (<i>He

the present</i>.</p>

<p class="normal"><i>The scene represents a drawing-room on the ground floor. In
the rear are wide glass doors which stand open, and permit a view of the terrace
and splendid park lying beyond. Windows to the right and left. On the right
side, a sofa with table and chairs; on the left, a secretary with writing
materials. Handsome old-fashioned decorations, pictures of battles, portraits in
oval frames, racing prints, etc. The terrace is sheltered by a broad awning
which slightly subdues the glare of the bright summer afternoon.</i></p>

<br>
<p class="hang1"><span class="sc2">Wilhelm</span> (<i>servant over sixty, in
half livery, is engaged in arranging the samovar for the afternoon coffee</i>). <span class="sc2">
Agnes</span> (<i>extremely slender, nervous, with traces of mental
distress--twenty years of age--blonde hair smoothed on the temples, light muslin
gown, a garden hat in her hand--enters from the terrace</i>).</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Wilhelm, has the postman been here?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span> (<i>sighing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, yes, he was here.</p>

<p class="normal">Where are the things?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">They are on the table, Fräulein.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Goes quickly to the table and with feverish haste looks
through the small pile of newspapers and letters lying there</i>.) Again,
nothing!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, indeed--and this is the seventh day. Ah, it is really heart-breaking.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are your master and mistress still taking their afternoon nap?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>.</p>

<h2><i>SECOND SCENE</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p class="normal"><span class="sc2">THE SAME</span>. <span class="sc2">MAJOR VON
DROSSE</span> (<i>about fifty, tall, broad-shouldered, rather stout.
Dark-grayish full beard parted in the middle, waving right and left over his
shoulders. In the full, well-browned face with flashing eyes and bushy eyebrows,
there are energy and abundant vitality, controlled by the self-command and
chivalric manner of an old officer. Brief in speech, domineering, but never
without a gleam of inner kindness</i>).</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Afternoon, Agnes!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Afternoon, uncle!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Goes to the table, examines the letters, sits down and
looks straight before him for a little while</i>.) Wilhelm!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What does the Major wish?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Stephan is to come at once to the castle.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, Major. (<i>Exit</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Agnes, my child, just listen to me ... You are a reasonable
creature ... One that I can talk to.... So the rascal has again not written. He
should have come to us, day before yesterday. Has made no excuses--doesn't
write--nothing. That has not happened during the six years that he has been away
from home. I ordered him most strictly to send a letter, or at least a card,
every day--for with her illness, your aunt must be guarded against the slightest
anxiety or excitement. He knows that, and moreover has always observed it
conscientiously. I can't any longer be responsible for your aunt and her
weakened heart. Unless we use every means to keep her in her--visionary life,
she will go to pieces.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Uncle!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">We must make up our minds to that, Agnes. Really, I do what I
can. Yesterday I even forged a telegram to her--you know that, eh! I did intend
to write to his intimate friend Hallerpfort, but thought better of it. I shall
drive into town directly after dark. Without your aunt knowing it, of
course--for now, during the harvest, that would upset her still more. So you
will stay all night with her, and er--well, the rest I will arrange with
Stephan.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, dear uncle.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Just come here, girl, look me in the face ... We two know each
other and ... Eh?</p>
<br>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Agnes </span><i>casts down her eyes</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Now see, I know very well that for two years you have been
secretly corresponding with Fritz.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Uncle! (<i>Presses her hands to her face</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There, that will do, that will do, that will do.... You can
well believe, if I had been opposed to it on principle, I should have long since
put an end to the business, shouldn't I?... But there are things--well, in
short, that you don't understand. Well, I should not have begun about the matter
to-day, but necessity knows no law, eh? And if I go to see him this evening, I
don't wish to grope altogether in the dark.... So--on the basis of what has just
been said--have you, perhaps, by any chance had a letter from him?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, uncle!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hm!</p>
<br>

<p class="center">Agnes (<i>hesitating, embarrassed</i>).</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">For some time we have not corresponded.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So?--Ho, ho ...! Who is to blame for that?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, let us not talk about that, uncle. But from another
quarter, I have had news of him.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">When?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yesterday.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And that you have----?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Taking a letter from her pocket</i>.) Please read--and I
think you will not reproach me.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc2">Major</span> (<i>unfolding the letter</i>).</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Ah, from the little Frohn! Now then, what does the little
Frohn write? (<i>Reads, muttering</i>.) Lanskis--Steinhof--met cousin--danced (<i>aloud</i>).
Indeed, then he could dance, but not write, that is a nice business--I should
not have believed it of him at all.... (<i>Reads further, muttering</i>.) Eyes
for the so-called beautiful Frau von Lanski ... The whole regiment is talking of
it.... Hm! eh, what! Such a goose! What things such a goose does cackle!...
Regiment has other things to bother itself about.... But such a regulation goose
... If a young lieutenant like that isn't all the time trotting after them. And
when he once shows attention to a lady who doesn't belong to the regiment ...
Besides, the Lanski is nearly forty ... Such idiocy! Then he might at
least--hm--hm--eh, pardon! Now then, what is it?... My poor old girl ... Yes,
yes, jealousy ... You have borne up disgracefully since yesterday.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I think I have controlled myself, uncle?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, very true, girl, no one has noticed anything.</p>

<p class="normal">Come in!</p>
<br>

<p class="center">(<i>Enter </i><span class="sc2">Stephan</span>.)</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, my dear Stephen, I must drive into town directly
after dark. Unless I should be detained, I shall be here early to-morrow
morning--four and a half and four and a half more miles--nine miles.... The
coach horses have been exercised to-day?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Stephan</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, indeed, Major.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Which are in better condition now, the browns or the whites?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Stephan</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That I don't permit myself to decide, Major. They have all had
it severely!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, I will just go and have a look myself. Wilhelm--cap!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, Major. (<i>Exit to the right</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And at half after nine this evening, send a message to my wife
and have her told that I must stay all night at the brick kilns--eh, you
remember (<i>softly, looking around at </i><span class="sc2">Agnes</span>) how we managed it the other
times when I was out at night.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Where is that fellow stopping with my cap? (<i>Enter </i>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span> (<i>softly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Fräulein, just now as I went out, Lieutenant von Hallerpfort
was standing there and wished to speak with Fräulein, privately. Neither the
master nor the mistress is to know anything of it ... God, Fräulein is deadly
pale!</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Meeting the lieutenant as he enters</i>.) Herr von
Hallerpfort, what has happened to Fritz?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing, Fräulein, not the least thing.... I am surprised that
he is not yet here.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span> (<i>rising joyfully</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Ah! (<i>With a sigh of relief</i>.) Ha!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I beg pardon a thousand times if I startled you.</p>

<p class="normal">Will you please take a seat.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thank you, most humbly! (<i>They are seated</i>.) Your uncle

<p class="normal">Uncle has just gone to the stables, and aunt's coming will be
announced to us.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How is your aunt?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, I thank you, much as usual.--Herr von Hallerpfort, be
frank with me: What is this all about?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, absolutely nothing of any consequence. A little
surprise--nothing further--nothing further!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">To be sure, if he is really on his way here--didn't you ride
here together?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, I came by the way of the levee, and thought to overtake
him. He will have ridden by the highway.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then what is the object of this secrecy?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That will soon be cleared up, Fräulein.... At this moment, in
Fritz's interest, I have to ask a great favour of you.... It is now (<i>takes
out his watch</i>) three forty-five o'clock. At four o'clock let us say five
minutes after four--even if we take into account some unforeseen delay--yes--he
must be here.... How long does it take to go to the village to Braun's inn?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ten minutes--that is, by a short cut through the park, about
five.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Thank you most humbly. Then will you have the great kindness
to reckon by your watch a half hour from the moment when he comes in here, and
then send me a message to Braun's where I am stopping?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At Braun's? I think you know, Herr von Hallerpfort, that this
house----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, certainly that I know!... I only made the mistake of
putting my horse at the entrance to Braun's, and as he doesn't belong to me, it
is my duty to look after him.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And all that is the truth?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Absolutely.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Agnes</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I should not be so persistent--forgive me for it--but here we
have all been so distressed about him. For nearly a week, we have sat and waited
for news.... Tell me truly.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span> (<i>entering at the left</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Fräulein, your aunt.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Hallerpfort</span> (<i>springing up</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Good-bye, then! And be reassured, it is all about a
joke--about----</p>

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau von Drosse</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, Richard, you surely know.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, nonsense! Don't worry yourself uselessly.... A young
badger like that--service and casino and what not! I used not to do any better
myself ... Eh, Wilhelm, that you will have remembered even in your booziness?
Many a time I didn't write for four weeks.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Wilhelm</span> (<i>who is handing the coffee</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, Major.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And were you at all worried then?</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, Major.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Old donkey.... Well, you see how it is ... The same old story.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau von Drosse</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Richard, do you know, last night a thought came to me. They
all idolise him--that boy.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes?</p>

<p class="normal">So far as they wish to get married--no.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau von Drosse</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But there is another who takes a very special interest in
him--motherly, as one might say.... No, motherly is not just the right word, but
at any rate, purely human, purely spiritual--you know what I mean. At the last
ball in Wartenstein, she questioned me at length about him, about his childhood,
and everything possible. At the time I was really rather indignant, but now it
pleases me.... I shall write to her to-day and ask her to keep an eye upon him.
For you see, a woman's influence--that is what he needs.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, the poor devil! And for that purpose, one of the kind....
Who then is it?</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, indeed--well, to be sure, hm--that is quite probable.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau von Drosse</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Their estate is quite close to the city ... There he could
always go in the evenings ... If only the husband were not so rude. I should be

<p class="normal">Well, you are not a lieutenant of hussars, darling.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau von Drosse</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, the stupid fig-coffee. To be sure, your health is good,
you don't need anything of the kind! (<i>drinks</i>) Richard, do you know, last
night I saw a vision.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, what did you see this time, darling?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau von Drosse</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There was a wide chamber with many mirrors and lights--perhaps
it was Versailles--perhaps the castle at Berlin. And hundreds of generals stood
there and waited.... (<i>Excitedly</i>.) And suddenly the door was opened wide
and at the side of the Emperor----</p>

You know, Richard, perhaps they are to increase his pay.</p>

<p class="normal">Surely he has enough, darling. Do you wish him to gamble it
away?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau von Drosse</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well, then, let him gamble it away. I find that in
general we pay so little heed to him.... I am obliged to think all the time how
he acted in a roundabout way in the matter of Foxblaze. He didn't trust himself
even to tell it.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc2">Major</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">No, child--but just stop.... Besides the charger he already
has two others ... And one of them is Mohammed! Such a big stable--it is only a

<p class="normal">Remarkable. In my time, the cavalry rode in patrol service

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, the old man<a name="div2Ref_02" href="#div2_02"><sup>[2]</sup></a>

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, I had to unsaddle, and anyhow have ridden four and a

not long ago, I fell from the trapeze and sprained my arm a bit.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Frau von Drosse</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You see, Richard, that is what hurt him just now; and yet you
scolded him.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Mamma, father is right.... A soldier is not allowed to show
signs of pain--he has no pain. That is something which doesn't happen, it is
something which doesn't happen at all, does it, Agnes?</p>

<p class="normal">Nothing, father, absolutely nothing ... What should be the

<p class="normal">How so?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you please ... That is, I should like a glass of water. (<i>Tosses

<p class="normal">How can a father be said to insult his son? If you don't
believe me, then you just don't believe me.</p>

<p class="normal">But we are both officers, my son.... Well, let us set that
aside--besides that, we are a couple of good friends from time immemorial....
Isn't that the case--are we not?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, to be sure.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And when I see you running about here--in ecstasy or
despair--I can make nothing out of it. Yes, I should like to advise you to put a
little more confidence in me.... The affair is surely not so bad that a man of
experience cannot put it in order again.... So just sit down here a while....
Have you gambled?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, I have gambled too.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Have you lost?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, I have won.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then, as to women--how is it about women?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span> (<i>shrugs his shoulders</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Ah!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Boy, don't be so hard in the mouth.... Do you think I don't
know you are in love?...</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In love? Ah, good God!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Just think, my boy, only a year and a half ago, you came to me
one fine day and explained to me that you wished to engage yourself to Agnes....
You know that I have not the slightest objection to Agnes. She will make an
excellent Frau von Drosse.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed? Do you believe it?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But your twenty-one years and, ah, good God!... You still
carry about with you most merrily the eggshells on your back--as the infantry
carries the knapsack. You hadn't the slightest idea of what are commonly called
&quot;women&quot;--of course, I don't count barmaids and such people.... So I said to you:
&quot;My boy, let this interview be buried--and above all, so far as Agnes is
concerned.... Do as your father and your grandfather did! Get some experience
and--then come again.&quot; Don't you remember that?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I should think I did remember it.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span> (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">And now, it seems to me, you have had some experience.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, yes, there is no denying that.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span> (<i>still smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">You have in the end had a so-called &quot;passion,&quot; or are stuck in
the middle of it; which of the two I don't know. Yet to judge from the
discontinuance of your letters, the latter is the case.... Since we are here
together as two men, I will not expostulate with you further.... You know
perhaps the story of that abbé who, in society, once excused the absence of his
bishop with the words: &quot;Monseigneur est en retard à cause d'amour.&quot; To a certain
extent, this holds good in every case.... But in spite of that, on your mother's
account, don't do it again. That is my advice to you.... There! And now we'll
enter at once upon the matter itself.... Just see, Frau von Lanski is, it will
be admitted, a very charming woman, but----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span> (<i>impetuously</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Father, how do you come to refer to Frau von Lanski?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There, there, there, only take it calmly, only take it
calmly.... I know just what there is to know about such affairs, and I don't by
any means wish to pry into your secrets ... But so far as the grand passion is
concerned, be calm.... I can cure you again ... Be quite calm.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That I can well believe, father, if only you have the time
necessary to do it.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span> (<i>smiling</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Well, why haven't I?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Because, in twenty-four hours, I shall be a dead man.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Springing up, and taking him by the shoulder</i>.) Boy!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Father, I did not wish to tell anything. I came here only to
take farewell of you in silence. But you have drawn it out of me, father.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span> (<i>flying into a passion</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">So, there's a scandal.... You had to carry it to the point of
making a scandal--you damned fool! (<i>More calmly</i>.) Lanski has challenged
you?</p>
<br>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">Fritz </span><i>nods assent</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, yes--and it is well known--Lanski is a dead shot. He is
perhaps the best shot anywhere hereabouts.... But still your wrist is in good
order. How can one throw the thing away like that? I have fought three duels,
and two of them under difficult conditions--eh--and--there, see here! How can
one say such a thing? How can one, man?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Father, the affair at this moment is in such a state that,
after all, I don't know whether I shall be granted a duel!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span> (<i>hoarsely</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">I don't understand that, Fritz.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It was--not--at hand, father.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It was not at hand.... Hm!... Now I understand it all. Surely
there is nothing left to wish! And this catastrophe occurred when?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yesterday evening, father!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At what time?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It was still--daylight!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ha, ha!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Father, only don't laugh! Have pity on me!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Have you had pity on me?... Or on your mother? or on--on....
Just look, look about you ... All that was made for you!... All that was waiting
for you.... For two centuries we Drosses have struggled and scraped together and
fought with death and devil merely for you.... The house of Drosse was resting
on your two shoulders, my son.... And you have let it fall into the mire, and
now you would like to be pitied!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Dear father, listen.... Since you have known it, I am quite
calm.... What you say is all very true, but I cannot bear the responsibility
alone. Listen; when I came to you that time, on account of Agnes, my whole heart
was attached to her. So far as I was concerned, other men's wives could go to
the devil.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Did I drive you, then, after other men's wives?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, father, otherwise what does that mean: &quot;Get some
experience, ripen, do as your father and grandfather did&quot;?... In the regiment,
they still call you the wild Drosse, and tales are still told of your former
love adventures.... They tell some such stories even of a late date.... For my
part, I had not the least taste for such diversions. I used to see in every
woman who did not belong to me, a sort of holy thing.... That may have been a
green way of looking at it, but you would have allowed it; and with Agnes, I
should have quietly----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Stop! Have pity! Stop!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">See, now you say to me all at once, &quot;have pity&quot;--Father, I am
a dying man, I did not come here to make reproaches, but do you make none to me!</p>
<br>

<p class="normal">Silence, silence, father! Mother should not hear that.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, forgive me for giving way. It shall not happen again....
So how does the affair stand now?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I reported myself to the old man, that very night.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My God! Whatever did the old Frohn say?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Spare me that, father.... Of course, I obtained the usual
furlough at once, until the discharge comes. Well, that doesn't matter now....
It does not last long, thus.... This morning, the court of honor had a sitting.
After my hearing, I rode away at once, so as to lose no time. I gave Mohammed to
Hallerpfort in order to have him follow me as soon as judgment was pronounced.
He may be here at any moment.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why did you summon a court of honor?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What was I to do, father, after Lanski declared to those who
delivered my challenge that I was no longer--capable of having satisfaction?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah! I will shoot the dog dead for that.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, I hope they will decide favourably to me.</p>
<br>

couple of measures to take so as to have a steady hand. Sleep properly, and
don't eat a bite, and then tell the doctor----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Enough, enough, father, that is of no further use.</p>

<p class="normal">What does that mean? Is it possible that you will--to

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

nothing more of life for me than a half-respectable death....</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Major</span> (<i>brokenly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Perhaps--they will not--grant you--the duel.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Fritz</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, if we have got to that last hope, father, then we are
indeed in bad straits.... Shall I perhaps open a dram-shop in Chicago, or a
cattle business with my paternal capital? Yes? Would you have done it?</p>

besides--I am painting.</p>

<p class="normal">Look at him! A ray of light is of more value to him than all
the foolish, gaudy songs of love. Is it not true? See, his very silence and bow
betoken decided resistance.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Madam, forgive me if my words and bearing were an occasion and
reason for misunderstanding. I speak now, because you call on me to speak. Every
ray of light is a ray of love, and if its portrayer were to shut it out, I
should like to know what would remain of this poor art which derives its
sublimest power from the sources of desire. If our heart does not tremble in our
hand, if into the flood of forms which stream from it, no flash of inner
lightning shines, how shall we express in these colours life's image, the storm
of the passions, the shy play of slight feeling, the desperate vacillation of
exhausted hope, and all the rest of our inner life? In these seven blotched
colours (<i>points to the palette</i>) where the whole wide universe is
portrayed, where if our senses are starving for truth, is phantasy to look for
food and deliverance? Yet if we have to speak with wisdom, elegantly and
cleverly, then the mysterious volition is silent and the promised land recedes
far away from us. Therefore, madam, leave me what belongs to us who are poor,
the sacred right to create and to be silent.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You call yourself poor and yet you are rich. You might be
equal to the rulers of this earth. Yet what avails the kingdom of your vision?

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How, your Majesty?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Like a Harpagon, you guard the treasures of your soul, lest

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">On the contrary, she cools him off.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I wonder if she truly loves him?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">At any rate, she wishes to excite him.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There, Jean, <i>merci</i>.... Yet what was I about to say, has
no one seen anything of our Marshal?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span> (<i>softly</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Is he still missing?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why does she want <i>him</i>, too?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I really believe the good Marshal is offended. It is three

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">May it please your Majesty, a gentleman of the court met him
to-day. He was standing in a pouring rain, and trying a new sword.</p>

<p class="normal">Too often I have heard his name spoken in wonder, here with
disfavour, there with enthusiasm, yet always as if a miracle was happening to
me, too often for me not to view with apprehension the nearness of this powerful
man.</p>

<p class="normal">That is splendid!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Gentlemen, I must beg you! At court, the master has good
company. It amuses me when he meets your insolence with wit and spirit, and
gives you a return thrust. Only try the experiment! I am waiting.... Please,
Jean, my handkerchief!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I have a right to be angry!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, indeed, you have been insulted!</p>

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I thank you, Jean.... Well, now, you dear men, you whisper,
sulk, and mutter to each other. What is the use of my kindling your wit? I don't
strike even a little spark from the stone. So you are dismissed.... Take a
holiday. And do you, my children, go home. But in a little while, master, let us
talk together, after our hearts' desire! The ladies of the suite--they will not
disturb you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I believe it. One of them is asleep.</p>

<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc2">THE MARQUISES</span>. <span class="sc2">THE

<br>
<p class="normal">(<span class="sc2">The Painter </span><i>paints, without

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ha, now I am going to kill him!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Don't you know it is forbidden? The punishment would be
severe. They say, too, that he wields a keen blade, and before you know it you
are dead as a mouse.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I am surprised at that. Yet whether we love or hate him, one
thing is as clear to me as day: he must not be allowed to quit this palace
alive.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">Another Marquis</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Pardon me, Marquis, why not?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You don't see deeply into this, Marquis. It seems almost as if
you were a simpleton. Has she not mocked us, and exclaimed at our cooing,
rustling, sweet speaking, and whimpering? Yet she delights to have him paint
her; and as a reward, she loves him.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Second Marquis</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ha, terrible!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Third Marquis</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Who told you that?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Have pity on us, friend, and give us proofs!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, his Majesty (<i>all bow</i>) is, alas, well on in years!
(<i>All assent sorrowfully</i>.) Whom else does she love? There must at any rate
be some one!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For God's sake, be prudent and speak softly!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What is he doing there?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Second Marquis</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He is eating.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Fie, how vulgar!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What will happen to the Marshal?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That seems to me doubtful. Sometimes she is pleasant with him,
sometimes ill-humoured. I have tried to get rid of him, but he still stays by
me. He causes me the pangs of jealousy. She must love one of us. We are here for
that purpose. Yet inasmuch as this wandering fellow has stolen her heart, he
must die--and that on the spot.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Patience, Marquis, patience! Of all the means of shaking off
this insolent fellow, there is one which is really exquisite. Without breaking
the laws, if we set the Marshal on him, instead of being disturbers of the
peace, we shall escape scot-free. He dies, of course, and it would be a
wonder--yet what am I saying?--He is already as good as a dead sparrow.</p>
<br>

<p class="center">(<i>All chuckle</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Dead sparrow is excellent!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">This murder--listen--is bound to put the other one into
disfavour. The King's Majesty (<i>all bow</i>) will shorten his leave of
absence, and we, we shall be freed of him.</p>
<br>

<p class="center">(<i>All chuckle</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What are they about? Alas, if they are glad, perhaps that
means the ruin of some man of honour. Perhaps they are meditating some ribaldry.
But in truth, what matters to me this vermin?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Now let us send out a message hastily to the Marshal, that we
are gathered in the antechamber, and while this poor dead mouse--no, pardon me
sparrow!--stammers his love to her, he, driven by us to extremes, will burst in
unannounced--and this fellow is detected.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very good! But if things turn out differently, what then?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Never mind! Take advantage of the right moment. No more is
needed. For she cannot refrain, she must see people kneel to her.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Famous! Brilliant! A splendid plan! (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">The Painter</span>,

<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Well, master, tell me: what is Genius doing?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, your Majesty, he is pursuing Beauty.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet since Beauty lingers no more on earth, your genius will
soon grow weary.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How so? Does your Majesty think it roams in the sky? It
lingers just at the goal and cries: Oh behold! and what thou beholdest, that
give to eternity!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I did not know, my dear master, that you were so ready with
your compliments. Very well! As a man of many travels and of great reputation,
you tread continually on the scorn of men; and since we are here chatting in
confidence, take heart and tell me without reserve, tell me quite frankly: am I
really beautiful?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If I were to speak as a man, every word would be presumptuous.
Yet you ask the painter only. And he says that his hand is withered with anxiety
lest on this canvas there will be found only a pale blotted vapour seen by a
blind man.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">There spoke the painter. But what says the man?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">He has no opinion, your Majesty!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What a pity! One hears now and then this thing and that thing,
yet that seems to me insipid above all things. And one must be strict and always
be suppressing--suppressing. You don't need that. So I tell you discreetly, I
can't resist the suspicion that my beauty is leaving me. Yes, indeed. And
besides that, I am growing old. Yes, indeed. I am almost thirty, and the matron
has to go to the rear. I indeed do what I can. They take great pains with me.
And my late brother used to send me a beauty powder from the holy sepulchre
which was good for my complexion. Then it is my habit to wash myself with the
extract of lilies, and off and on to nibble at arsenic bonbons. That is very
good--the eyes flash, and the blood comes to the cheeks.... (<i>Alarmed</i>.) It
seems to me I am confiding in you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Consider me as a thing--as a slave!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And you know how to be silent? Tell me--swear!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What you did not will me to hear, that I have not heard. What
I did not hear, I cannot keep as a secret.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Lofty sentiment and noble will find expression in you. So, in
all silence, I may show your heart what favours are granted to you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span> (<i>tremulously</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Am I worth it? And if you regret it to-morrow?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I do not know a to-morrow nor a to-day. My weary sense with
crippled wing never strays into the far future, for ah! I, poor, poor Queen,
suffer from intense melancholy. I have too much feeling. I have told you that
already, and then I am tired of my throne in this world of dreary elegance,
where----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Your Majesty! Remember the ladies there!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, the ladies! No chance favours me. That you have perceived
already. Yet there is no question of the ladies. One doesn't hear a word; the
other sleeps, even while standing up.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Sure enough.... Yet when I consider----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Consider nothing.... Give me only a consoling word, which in
the sultriness of this perverted nature may penetrate my soul like a breath from
the forest. You are a man!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span> (<i>laughing to himself</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Who has lost his head!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So I saw him in my dreams. I feel, too, that you could quite
overflow, and I am a little afraid of it.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Controlling himself with difficulty</i>.) Oh, fear
nothing. I know very well the barrier between me and the height of your throne.
Not a desire, not a thought, rises to you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And yet you think that I am beautiful?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span> (<i>impulsively</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, you are beautiful! You--(<i>restraining himself</i>).
Your Majesty, I beg you to turn a little more to the left.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Turns her head quite to the left</i>.) So?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What are you painting now?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Your hand.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span> (<i>pointing to her face</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">And it is for that, that I am to turn to the left?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I meant, just to the centre.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Is the hand well posed?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Very well.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Can you see it from where you sit?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, yes--(<i>she laughs</i>). Forgive me if I am talking
nonsense.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span> (<i>spreading out her hand</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Here you have it! How the sapphire sparkles! A beautiful
stone!... You praised my face, but yet you don't say whether you like my hand.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Instead of finding fault with me, look! I have painted it.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span> (<i>pouting</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">You have indeed painted it, but you have not kissed it. From
that I conclude that it is not attractive.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And forgive me, if I transgress the rules of your court, more
from shyness than from want of intelligence. Even so, the sailor knows well the
laws of the stars' movements and yet must often sail a false course.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It seems as if you wished to avoid the subject. I was speaking
of a hand--you speak of stars.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You were speaking of your hand and that is so far from me that
even the eternal will, the might which compels the starry heaven, brings it not
one inch nearer to me.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed, do you believe that? (<i>She rises and goes to the
easel</i>.) Now pray what happened? You willed nothing and compelled nothing,
yet please observe--the hand is there.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Madam, where others fell down before you, here it is my duty
to warn you. I am not a simple shepherd, and never do I let people make game of
me.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, now it becomes interesting! You look at me as savagely as
if a hatred quite unappeased and unappeasable possessed you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A hatred? No, what I laughingly veiled from you was not
hatred, no--yet
<i>if</i> I hate, I hate myself, because, dazzled with splendour, like a
drowning man I grasp at the little words which you mockingly deal out to me;
because, after the manner of a venal courtier, I quite forgot the pride of the
man, and by your favour ate sweetmeats greedily from these hands! Yes, just show
them--the white fairy<a name="div2Ref_03" href="#div2_03"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
hands laden with the splendid tokens of love: yet stop--think of the end, by the
holy God--I recognise myself no more.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Never yet did I hear such words.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">When did you ever bow yourself to force? When did passion
build you a throne on the ruins of the universe, the only throne to win which is
more than an idle pastime, on which in splendid grandeur, instead of all the
queens, sits Woman! And if a drone playing in colours ever indeed won a smile
from you, take from me but your crown, for I, oh Queen, am--a man!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Shrinking back to the throne</i>.) Enough, I should not
listen to you any longer.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You must. You have so willed it.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I will beg you, sir, I will conjure you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Too late. You offered me love's pay as you would throw a gold
piece into the cap of a beggar crouching in the street, and if I, thrilled now
by hot desire, employ the only moment of life which commits you into my hands, I
will not have you play with me any longer. I will, and you--you--must--before
this throne our alliance is ratified. Take away the hand. That, others may kiss,
but I, Queen, will have the mouth. I will----</p>

MARSHAL</span>.</p>

<p class="center">The Queen.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Who until now has listened, anxious but not altogether
unfriendly, collects herself, and draws herself up in sudden anger</i>.) I
deliver this insolent fellow to you, Marshal. Deal with him as he deserves. (<i>She
goes to the door. There she stops, and gives </i><span class="sc2">The Sleepy Maid of Honour </span><i>
two angry little blows with her fan. The latter springs up, bows, and goes out

<br>
<br>
<h2><i>SIXTH SCENE</i>.</h2>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc2">THE MARSHAL</span>. <span class="sc2">THE
PAINTER</span>.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc2">The Marshal</span>.</p>
<br>
<p class="normal">Sir, if you wish to say a paternoster, make haste with it.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Your magnanimity affects me deeply, Marshal. But my soul
carries light baggage. Even so, it will journey to heaven. And instead of a last
testament, I present this portrait to you, so that, in the confusion, no serious
danger may happen to it.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">By your will, it has become mine, and I will gladly keep it.
So, draw your sword!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I, sir?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So, draw!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">No, that you will never live to see!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Then why do you wear a sword?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Because I choose to.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You are a coward.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Controlling himself, with a smiling bow</i>.) And you are
a hero! (<i>In the meanwhile the door at the centre is opened</i>. <span class="sc2">
The Marquises </span><i>put their heads in, listening</i>. <span class="sc2">The
Painter </span><i>observes it and takes his sword from the table where he has
just laid it</i>.) See! As the traveller uses the staff to defend himself
against dogs, so I must wield it. Such people are to be found at all doors where
small men work and lie in wait and play the parasite. (<span class="sc2">The
Marquises </span><i>draw back. The door at the centre is suddenly closed</i>.)
Yet ever to bare the sword against you, with whom, out of a timid trustfulness,
a bond, a splendid bond of pride, entwined me; whom of all the incompletely
great men, I admiringly called the only great man--if ever I were to be guilty
of such ignominy, I should not find my small share of peace even in the shade of
the most beautiful church-yard lindens.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are you still young?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I am not exactly old, yet my fortune has been so checkered and
various that I joyfully had given seven every-day lives for <i>one</i> surfeit
of this. And in the end--however one may work and strive, it is man's destiny:
he dies of Woman. Therefore, instead of passing away slowly by my own, I will
quickly find my end by the wife of another. My chariot of victory stops indeed
suddenly. I greet its well-appointed driver--and I greet my judge. Thrust on!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I may be a judge, but I am not an executioner. So do me the
favour----</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And fighting, let you run me through? No, Marshal! That I must
refuse. See! Each of us two has his art. You employ the sword, I the palette.
How would it be if I should say to you now in accordance with the practice of my
craft: Come, we will paint on a wager? And you do not know the merest precept of
light-value, azure, modelling. Very well, you are a dead man for me. Afterward
you might--that is allowed you--come to life into the bargain, if you liked.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You are mocking me, surely!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Surely, no! Yet every fight should be a fight on a wager.
Because in a fight between men you are a complete man, I should like to show
that I too can do something. You are laughing.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">One who is so nimble with his tongue has, it is said, a sure
hand. Perhaps, too, many a device unknown to me is concealed in the wielding of
your sword. So be quick, I pray you. I hear the sound of footsteps. Do you stare
at me in silence?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Still a little farther to the right!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">What does that mean?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">So!--And that may not be looked at, because one is mouldering
away! I cannot get over it. Never yet have I found lines like those, never yet a
working so gloriously true in the frontal plexus of veins, in the eyebrows, as
if one by pure will became a giant. The body delicate--the cheeks thin; for
Nature when she fashions her best, makes no boast of vigorous strength.... The
wish overpowers me--Before I die, sir, I must paint you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You seem altogether mad.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I beg you to grant me a respite. I shall be glad to let you
kill me, yet only after your portrait is finished.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And by your creation, you hope to obtain all manner of favour,
and quietly to escape. You are cunning indeed.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It is the peculiar pleasure of magnanimity to suspect the
magnanimity of others.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are you reading me a lecture?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It seems that I must. I must make an effort to win your
heart's esteem, which is worth more to me than any amount of foolish play with
briskly wielded swords.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">By heaven, sir, you risk a great deal!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I risk nothing. I am a man of death. The world lies behind
me--a many-colored picture which God has bestrewed with crumbs of white bread,
where each one snatches up and devours and yet does not satisfy his appetite.
Only in intoxication can a child of fortune know how the flowers beneath bloom
and wither. I have been able to, and my soul with every new work drank to
satiety. What matters it if life has deceived me? I asked nothing of it--that
was my strength. You see I am pronouncing my obituary. Yet I depart gladly....
Already the new host approaches and swarms for me in forests and on plains: What
matters it that this hand was mortal; for the portraying is as eternal as the
image.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You are mistaken. Only the deed is eternal. If with bloody
sword it did not teach mankind to remember, I should perish like a seed sown by
the wind.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It is you who are mistaken, sir. Not your deed has life. It
soon follows you into the grave. The portrait of the dead which we give to
posterity, in song and form, in parchment and stone, this it is which belongs to
immortality. By this you shall be hereafter loved and hated.--So even if
Achilles destroys the whole world, he has but to let Homer live.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And so I, you? Yet no song tells us that Homer ever kneeled
before Helen.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Not that. But every child knows why: the poor singer was
blind.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Your brush, alas, will not help you at all. Yet I should be
well disposed toward you. For he who in death seems to remain a trifler, has
taken life in earnest.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That is true.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I am sorry for you.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Without cause, I assure you!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And why could you not be silent? How did you so dare, contrary
to good reason to climb to your Queen? Did nothing within you say: this is a
crime?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You call it crime--I call it folly!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Do you pursue your secret pleasures, then, like a sly,
cold-hearted thief? The one thing fails which spoke in your favour, the almighty
love which disturbs the brain!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Marshal, see, love is a tribute which we piously pay to
eternal beauty; and since Nature in creative pride has poured it forth out of
her fulness, how should we in fretful resignation say: &quot;This one I love--not
that one&quot;? In my love, I love only the picture which proceeds from the lap of
pure forms; even as this Queen bestows it as a favour, so it sheds its light far
and near; and wherever a picture invites me to a banquet, my heart is present
without delay.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet I ask you whether <i>this</i> picture invited you to a
banquet. Speak quickly--by my sword!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You know very well that no gallant man should move an eyelash
at such a question.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">You do not love her--only like a faun you make bold to court
her madly. (<i>Taking hold of him</i>.) But I love her, and for this reason, you
must die.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Forgive me if I am surprised at your logic. It is a great
honour for me to know whom you love; moreover, you have already told me
repeatedly that I must die; yet that you are confused as to
this--is--indeed--only--temper. And see, it is but proper that you love her. The
contrary--according to court manners and practice--would be unnatural. Yet the
more important question seems to be: does she love you? You look away. Very
well, I will tell you. She has met you with smiles and furtive questions, with
sweet glances, half longingly, has promised you a thousand delights and
gradually has subdued you and your obstinacy. Yet if it involved keeping her
promises, she would understand how to wrap herself in her innocence.----It was
so--was it not? You are silent, because you are ashamed of the game. Pardon me,
sir, if I irritate your wounds.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It seems you set spies at the door!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Why spies? Eve's old practice, that, Marshal, I know well. Yet
what lies behind it, whether true love or not, for you or me, cannot be
deciphered. If I should survive the duel, she would probably love <i>me</i>: yet
because it is decreed that by your arm, you should be the victor in this absurd
quarrel, she will love you, Marshal. Where woman's glory rules the world, that
is the law--so says natural history. Do you say nothing?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A poison is distilled from your words which eats into the very
marrow of my soul.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Only the truth! I swear it, I promise it! And since against my
wish I am still very much alive, because of your favour, be of use to me, sir,
in an experiment.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Explain yourself!</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In order to know exactly how you are thought of in the highest
place, you must perish in the duel.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">In the duel?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Understand me rightly: only in appearance.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And my reputation as a swordsman goes with it into the
bargain.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, not at all! You will get up again.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span> (<i>laughing</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">My friend, I am not sorry that you are still alive. I have
become reconciled with you, and I who have dared a great deal in toil and
strife, am astonished at the extent of your courage. Very well, what your
cunning mind has devised for your escape, I accept. Yet woe to you if this time
you do not win! And now to the work!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Come on!... Yet no, by your leave! So that they may believe
the incredible about me, I will arrange the thing in naturalistic fashion. (<i>He
draws his sword</i>.) Is the door locked? (<i>He walks to the door at the
centre, and points his sword at the keyhole</i>.) Eyes away! I am going to
thrust! (<i>A scream is uttered in the antechamber</i>.) And now look out! I am
going to mark horrid pools of spilt blood! (<i>He mixes colours on the palette,
and hands the </i><span class="sc2">Marshal </span><i>his sword</i>.) Hold it, I beg you. (<i>He smears
the sword blade with his brush</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">My blood!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Without doubt! <i>Merci</i>. (<i>Takes back his sword</i>.)
Just one tap upon the breast. Yet in case you wish that I spare the waistcoat?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">By no means! That would be too much loss of blood!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Just as you please. (<i>He moves the easel and table to one
side. Softly</i>.) And make no mistake, the door will open at the first clash of
blades.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Are you ready?</p>
<br>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">The Painter </span><i>nods assent. They
fence</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Famous.... Do you know that feint?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It is a good one, is it not?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Who taught you that?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And this!...</p>

<p class="normal">There you missed the quint.</p>

<p class="normal">Damnation!...</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Ah, that was admirable!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yet at painting I do better.... Is any one listening?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">They are huddled together in a confused group.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Now, if you please!</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis In Pink</span> (<i>approaching

<p class="normal">We stand benumbed at such a glorious deed.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Oh, dear man, how could you think it? I wished only to afford
myself the rapture of seeing whether you had altogether freed us.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pale Blue</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, indeed, freed! For even although you hated him, you can
never imagine how, in the chambers of this castle, he has trodden on our
dignity.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marquis in Pink</span>.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I heard a rumour which greatly displeased me and troubled my
peace of mind extremely. Is it true?... There lies the great hero; and truly, in
death he seems even more insignificant than he was--as insignificant as one of
the most insignificant. Yet mourn with me! We have had a great loss. Even if
ambition urge you on with a double spur, many a fine day will come and go before
his like will be born to us.</p>
<br>

<p class="center">(<span class="sc2">The Marshal </span><i>clears his throat
softly</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">May his courtliness, too, be pleasantly remembered! After his
campaign he always brought back to his Queen the best of the splendid spoil of
his booty. That touched my royal heart and will be cited as a glorious example.
And yet now to you ... What did they say to me? It sounds almost untrue and
unnatural: are you the David of our Goliath? I use the term &quot;Goliath&quot; only
figuratively. For though we are mourning at his bier, it cannot be said that he
was a giant. Yet we know his disposition was haughty. (<span class="sc2">The Marquises </span><i>eagerly
assent</i>.) Surely he broke in upon you in sudden anger? You are silent out of
generosity. So I will graciously forgive this fault and another fault too. (<span class="sc2">The
Painter </span><i>clears his throat softly. She stretches out her hand to him, which he
kisses</i>.) And be not grieved! (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">The Marquises</span>.) Does not what has
happened seem almost like a judgment of God?</p>

<p class="normal">Until the return to my senses relieved me (<i>with emphasis</i>)

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Queen</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Quickly collecting herself. Sharply</i>.) My
congratulations, sir! And my sympathy as well! What has happened to you gives me
unspeakable distress. The court atmosphere is indeed rather close, and seems
insupportable to great conquerors; which often betrays itself in wrong fancies
and swoons. Therefore I am obliged to exercise my power as Queen, and protect
your good health against danger. Jean, announce me to his Majesty! (<i>Exit </i>

PAINTER</span>. <span class="sc2">THE MARQUISES</span> (<i>in the background</i>).</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">I thank you, sir! The mists are dissipated. The eye sees
clearly once more; the will has a free hand.</p>
<br>
<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But I was silently executed. Did you notice her look?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span> (<i>pointing at </i><span class="sc2">
The Marquises</span>).</p>

<p class="normal">Of looks, there are sufficient.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span> (<i>snatching up his sword</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Oho! I am always expecting foul play.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">For what reason? Get along with you! Get along with you! Be
quick!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">It is true. You are right. Here, we are ruined.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And what is to become of you?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">That has never troubled me. The world is wide. One can walk
about it, and find something to sketch by the way.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">How would it be if you went with me?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Where?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">To the camp.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes, and what is there?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Plenty for you! You will find gay fare, and pastimes and
diversions. As much as you want.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And are there fights too?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed, there are!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And will there be a bold reconnoissance by night?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Often.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Capital! I will ride with you. In my mind's eye I see already
golden moonrise, and silver vapour on the dark alder bush.... Are there also
songs and notes of the mandolin?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Plenty of them!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Hurrah! There is music too!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And in the story-telling by night at the camp-fire many a tale
of human destiny will be unfolded to you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">A world of pictures! (<i>More softly</i>.) And love
adventures?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">If you choose to call them &quot;adventures.&quot;</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Agreed, sir! And an excess of happiness will flow out of my
soul like a prayer.--Yet it seems I am forgetting the greatest happiness. I
shall be with you. I may paint you.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Take care!</p>

Honour</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Now the hastily contrived reward of our misdeeds is at hand. (<i>To </i>
<span class="sc2">Jean</span>.) My noble sir, bestir yourself. (<i>To </i><span class="sc2">
The Painter</span>.) That is the handsome Jean as an angel of justice! (<i>He
unfolds the scroll and reads, laughing</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">And to me, what do you bring to me?</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Valet</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>With an expression of awkward contempt</i>.)
You?--Nothing!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Exquisite!</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Valet</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">But yes! Your reward shall be meted out to you in the office
of the Marshal of the court.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span> (<i>amused</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">Indeed?</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Valet</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Yes! (<i>Behind the scenes on the right are heard cries of
&quot;Jean! Jean!&quot;</i>)</p>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Deaf Maid of Honor</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Hurries in from the right</i>.) Jean! Have you forgotten
her Majesty?</p>

The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">(<i>Look at each other, and break out into laughter</i>.)</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Marshal</span>.</p>

<p class="normal">Look, look, my friend! He seems to have got into bad habits.</p>
<br>

<p class="center"><span class="sc">The Painter</span> (<i>pointing at him</i>).</p>

<p class="normal">It is rightly so. I had almost begged him, at the court where
we men are forbidden, proudly to represent the eternal masculine. (<i>Laughing,
they both bow to him</i>.)</p>

<p class="center">(<i>Exit </i><span class="sc2">The Valet</span>.)</p>
